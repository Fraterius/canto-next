== TESTS ==

Each directory encompasses one test.

    Run all tests: ./run.sh */

    Run one test: ./run.sh testname

In addition, there are two other scripts.

clean.sh will clean all visible files from a test directory (takes the same
arguments that run.sh)

setuptest.sh will clean a directory and in addition copy the skel files into
the directory and start a canto-daemon there. This is useful if you want to
run a client by hand there. This also takes the same arguments as run and
clean.
